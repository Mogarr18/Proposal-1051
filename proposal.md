# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Creating a Mod in Minecraft

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to create a mod that adds new entities and mobs to the game. If I achieve this, I may do more than just that.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will add new entities to Minecraft. It will add new mobs with independent behavior, items and textures to the game. It will be created in java code and I will use Blockbench for creating textures.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I would like to add at least one new mob that has redifined movement and animations.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to add a creature that will have redifined movement and animations that interacts with its ecosystem around it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to create a fully developed mod that I can publish for people to download that adds multiple creatures, items, and textures to the game that all interact with the ecosystem and other aspects of the game

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For this project, I will have to learn more coding in java than I know currently. I will have to learn how to learn the blockbench application. I will have to learn how the existing code of movement and interaction between mobs and items works as well as how to assign new NBT data to items.
